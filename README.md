# Introduction
This is a repository for Imperial College London Deep Learning coursework (2018-2019). The dataset is N-HPatches (Noisy HPatches) which can be found [here](https://github.com/MatchLab-Imperial/deep-learning-course). Utility functions are also used, which is provided [here](https://github.com/MatchLab-Imperial/keras_triplet_descriptor). 

# Instruction to execute the source code
The source code is attached in this repository, which you can download from this repository or view it on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CliveWongTohSoon/EE3-25-Deep-Learning-2018-2019-CW3915/blob/master/cw3915_DL.ipynb).
